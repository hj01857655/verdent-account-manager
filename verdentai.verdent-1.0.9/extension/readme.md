# Verdent for VS Code

Verdent is an advanced agentic coding platform built by the Verdent team, designed for software development professionals. With a deep understanding of multiple programming languages, frameworks, algorithms, and software engineering best practices, Verdent can independently handle long-term tasks and also complete complex projects in collaboration with users. Its mission is to assist users across the entire software engineering lifecycle—from coding and debugging to system design and technical brainstorming.
